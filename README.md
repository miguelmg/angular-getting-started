This codebase is a result of follow the Angular Getting Started guide. You can see the guide [here](https://angular.io/start)

# Getting started

Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation) installed globally. We use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) to manage the dependencies. 
You can install it from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), then run `npm install` to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Building the project
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
